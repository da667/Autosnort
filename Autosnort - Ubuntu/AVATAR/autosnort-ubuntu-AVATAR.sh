#Autosnort script for Ubuntu 12.04+

#Functions, functions everywhere.

# Logging setup. Ganked this entirely from stack overflow. Uses FIFO/pipe magic to log all the output of the script to a file. Also capable of accepting redirects/appends to the file for logging compiler stuff (configure, make and make install) to a log file instead of losing it on a screen buffer. This gives the user cleaner output, while logging everything in the background, for troubleshooting, analysis, or sending it to me for help.

#Okay, so not only does the new filename format on snort.org for the snort tarballs allow three digits, pulledpork is expect 4 digits, separated by 3 periods. For example, If the current snort version is 2.9.11, you need to specify snort version 2.9.11.0 in pulledpork for it to figure out what version of snort you want to download rules for. So I made this little work-around: IF there are only two periods in the "snortver" variable, that means that I will need to add a trailing ".0" otherwise, pulledpork should be fine. Unfortunately, This value had to be stored in a new variable "ppsnortver" because other parts of the script rely on "snortver" variable not being modified from its original format to work properly.
