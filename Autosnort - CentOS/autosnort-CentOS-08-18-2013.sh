#Functions, functions everywhere.

# Logging setup. Ganked this entirely from stack overflow. Uses named pipe magic to log all the output of the script to a file. Also capable of accepting redirects/appends to the file for logging compiler stuff (configure, make and make install) to a log file instead of losing it on a screen buffer. This gives the user cleaner output, while logging everything in the background, in the event they need to send it to me for analysis/assistance.

#Use pulled pork to provide the default security over connectivity ruleset (easy mode)

# If the user selects option 1, we do a couple of sanity checks to make sure the user gave us a valid file that is a tarball.
# Then we process it and move the rules where snort expects to find them.
# Three things --
# 1. This method only supports VRT rule tarballs
# 2. This method does NOT verify the so rules of the rule tarball are compatible with the version of snort installed.
# 3. The user will need to use some way to create a sid-msg.map (such as oink master's create-sidmap.pl script), the sid-msg.map included in the snortrules tarball is NOT up to date.

# If the user selects option 2, we do necessary to give the user a base security over connectivity ruleset via pulled pork, and a reference snort.conf from labs.snort.org:
# 1. pull packages via apt
